This was my 1st Big Project (over 500+ lines of code) in C, i have done it when i was in 1st year computer engineering at kultur university
around the mid-term exam times, it took me around 5 days, between 8-10 hours of dedicated work, i did get help from chatgpt, but, only 
through logic, like how am i gonna do this and that.

even though logic is probably harder than coding, it's my first attempt of trying to make something that'll take time, and next times 
hopefully i'd try doing everything alone.

The game is a text-based rpg game, where you fight 7 enemies and 1 boss, the game does need strategy and some bit of luck, it was fun
making it, but sometimes hard too, where at a time, i was going to destroy my whole code because of frustration, but that's how i got
better, by being patient and still going, even though i got stuck.

i'm not thinking of adding updates or anything to this game, just because i don't want to spend alot of time on a game that doesn't have 
visuallity, maybe in the future, i'll make a game that's 2d or 3d in a game engine, and get to update that game, but this game i won't 
update it even once, just because it feels useless.
